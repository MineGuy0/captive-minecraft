When adding to your world or server you have to do the following steps:

Step 1: move "captive" into the datapack folder of your world (make a new world for best experience)
Step 2: load world and set the worldborder to atleast 10 blocks (make sure you can get an advancement)
Step 3: have fun, can you survive inside a border that only inceases with an advancement, is it possible to reach the end??

Edit config:
there is only 1 file you need to edit to change the size changing:
"datapack/data/adv/done.mcfunction" change the 100 to any number of size you want it to expand by, i chose 100 as default.

This might seem like a very small read me but its just to get you started up THANKS FOR USING CAPTIVE MINECRAFT 1.16.X
